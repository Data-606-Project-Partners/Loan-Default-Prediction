# Loan-Default-Prediction
### Project Background:
When banks are choosing which individuals are allowed to receive a loan, banks are often forced to predict whether or not to trust that an individual will default on his loan, or be able to pay it back in full.  In efforts to prevent their own losses, banks have developed strategies for mitigating their own risk, such as credit ratings.  Significant research has gone into creating methods of classifying potential loan candidates into either of the two categories "loan" or "defaulting", but often overlooked is the opportunity to guage what limit risky individual can afford before the default occurs.  

This project hopes to create an algorithm that will allow users to input certain identifying factors and **(1) determine whether an individual should be considered safe from default**, or **(2) determine what the maximum amount of credit he/she could receive before being unable to return the full quantity of the loan**.  If something similar were applied professionally, it might allow banks to capitalize on opportunities for loans that might otherwise be ignored due to the investment being too risky.

### Project Purpose:
Create a model that will illustrate: \
(1) whether a loaning account will default, \
(2) what conditions will cause that default to occur, \
(3) and how much money the bank will have been able to recoup from the lendee before default.
