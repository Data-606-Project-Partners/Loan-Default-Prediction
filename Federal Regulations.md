# Federal Regulations 

Lending Institutions must comply with federal regulations as well when crediting or denying loans.  There are many federal regulations that are aimed at protecting individuals from discrimination, which brings about the added caveat that the process by which a loan is judged too risky or not **must be auditable**.  This can be a hindrance to the use of machine learning in the field, since **any architecture that is used to determine someone's qualification for a loan must be inspectable, understandable, and quantifiable**.
